#  **China Air Pollution Analysis Dashboard**

##  *"Unmasking the air we breathe"*

Air pollution is a major environmental concern in China, affecting millions of people every day. The increasing concentration of pollutants like **PM2.5**, **NO₂**, and **SO₂** due to urbanization and industrialization poses serious health risks.

By analyzing data from selected regions, we aim to explore trends, assess air quality, and aid better decision-making.

**Selected Stations for Analysis**

To ensure geographical and environmental diversity, we selected **4 representative stations** from the Beijing region:

1. **Guanyuan** – ️ *Urban*  
   • **Location**: Central Beijing  
   • **Why**: Represents dense urban traffic and pollution load.

2. **Shunyi** –  *Suburban*  
   • **Location**: Northeast suburb of Beijing  
   • **Why**: Shows suburban growth and industrial influence.

3. **Changping** – ️ *Semi-Rural*  
   • **Location**: Northern fringe of Beijing  
   • **Why**: Useful for comparing urban vs agricultural pollution sources.

4. **Dingling** –  *Rural/Historic*  
   • **Location**: Near mountains, north Beijing  
   • **Why**: Offers a cleaner environment for baseline comparison.
